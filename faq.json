Therefore it will disconnect after a short period of time of inactivity to save energy. If the hardware is designed by you or your team, consider changing power mode of the Bluetooth chip on the peripheral device."

                "answer" : "There are two ways to write data to a characteristic. The most common is: withResponse. This means, that after a write operation you get a callback from the peripheral if it was successful. Otherwise you get an error message. But some peripherals might not support this mode. In the app this is marked with a red 'W' on the characteristic. In this case you have to switch to the withoutResponse mode.\n\nSome characteristics may support both modes. In this case you should use the withResponse mode."

                "answer" : "When in terminal you will see a new entry whenever the peripheral changes the value of the characteristic. This only works if the characteristic is configured to notify changes. This needs to be setup on the Bluetooth chip of the hardware. However you can choose to poll data changes from the characteristic. This will fetch the characteristic value once every second"
